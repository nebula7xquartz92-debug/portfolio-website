    <h1>Human Indomitability</h1>

    <section id="spirit">
      <h2>1. The Human Spirit is Indomitable</h2>
      <p>Humans are, at their core, resilient. History shows that despite suffering, ignorance, conflict, and even near-extinction events, we persist. Our social nature allows us to thrive in groups—but even alone, individuals can rise above immense challenges.</p>
      <p>Examples: Alexander the Great, Marie Curie, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, and Ludwig van Beethoven—succeeding through discipline, persistence, and focus against the odds.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="limits">
      <h2>2. Nature, Free Will, and Limits</h2>
      <p>Humans are rational, yet emotions influence high-stakes decisions. Instinct dominates youth; consciousness guides adults. We can pursue godlike achievements (biotech, atom-level manipulation, AI), but reality sets boundaries.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="morality">
      <h2>3. Morality and Logic</h2>
      <p>Logic governs outcomes; morality governs choices in ambiguity. Harm is justified only in defense of self, loved ones, or the collective.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="passion">
      <h2>4. Passion, Obsession, and Fulfillment</h2>
      <p>Pursue mastery aligned with skill and passion. Obsession is laudable if disciplined and humble. Success is personal—measured by alignment with values, not external approval.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="ethics">
      <h2>5. Human Nature and Ethics</h2>
      <p>Humans protect and value their own. Intelligence is a tool, not divine. Actions outside natural structures without ethics are questionable.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="nihilism">
      <h2>6. Nihilism and Perspective</h2>
      <p>Cosmically, nothing matters—but human-scale meaning exists through patterns, growth, and connection. Practical nihilism is acknowledged but ignored in action.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="action">
      <h2>7. Principles for Action</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Use discipline, humility, intelligence as tools for growth.</li>
        <li>Recognize biological, physical, and reality-based limits.</li>
        <li>Pursue obsession wisely; elevate others through mentorship.</li>
        <li>Build frameworks that expand human potential for lasting impact.</li>
      </ol>
